## Upcoming talk

#### Join me on Wednesday 23rd of June at [NDC Melbourne](https://ndcmelbourne.com/agenda/chasing-the-holy-grail-reusable-web-components-and-design-tokens/5dbb8b972e1f)

> Itâ€™s still normal at large companies to copy and paste styles and components between projects only to inevitably rewrite it all again into the latest framework every couple of years. 

In this session, we will look at building design systems with web components that can be used in any frontend framework. We will discuss the team you need to pull it off and how to keep your design tokens in code. Join us from the trenches as we look at options for you to build your next frontend (and the next one, and the next one....)
